General hints:
pawn_value = 256
ply = 16

Engine-Options:
Hash: size in MB
Threads: max 2 cores (could be more, but i can't test it at the moment)
MultiPV: limited to max 8 variants (could be more, but who really needs that)
GUI_Lag: time in millisec for gui-delay
Timing:  remaining time is divided with this value basically (but will be changed by other criteria)
PawnStruct: just this, set it to 0, and DesasterArea will ignore doublepawns etc.
Candidates: pawns, that could become a passer
Passers: against stronger engine always wrong (to high or to low ;-) )
Mobility: mobility of pieces (no pawns and king)
King_Safety: mainly pawn_shield and some extras
King_Attacks: just this
CenterControl: knights, king and pawns are excluded
Pins: pieces pinned to king
PSQT: = pst 
Oracle: some general rules (same as misc in Stockfish), no precalc of psqt
AB_Window: value 0 turns it off (no fail-high or low)
QVS_Checks: allowed depth in quiesce for silent check-moves
Bishop_Pair: set to pawn_value/2 (some modern engines seem to give more than that)
Check_Extension: 1 ply
Single_Move_Extension: engine is in check and there is only one move
SE_Extension: singular move extension, triggers in at remaining depth >= 8 ply)
Min_Split_Depth: for 2 cores (5 ply default seems best)
Min_SE_Depth: default 8 ply 
Min_LMR_Depth: remaining depth to do LMR-Reductions, set it to 1600, and LMR is switched off
Max_Static_Nullcut_Depth: 0 means no static_nullcut (can be usefull for analysis)
Max_Razoring_Depth: 0  means no razoring (can be usefull for analysis)
Max_NC_Futility_Depth: 0 means no nodecount futility, moves that will be completly ignored
Max_SEE_Futility_Depth: 0 means no see futility, only good captures
Max_Gain_Futility_Depth: 0 means no positionell gain futility
Attack_Scale_0: no direct attacks to king-squares, only safe checks may be available
Attack_Scale_1: 1 piece has direct attacks to king-squares
Attack_Scale_2: 2 pieces have direct attacks to king-squares
Attack_Scale_3: 3 and more pieces have direct attacks to king-squares
Ponder: dummy, pondering is controlled by gui
Eval_Hash: testing feature, memory is allocated always
Pawn_Hash: testing feature, memory is allocated always
Nullmove: can be switched off here
Null_Verification: dito
Delta_Pruning: only captures, that raise value to or above alpha in quiesce
Singular_Extensions: redundand, can be switched off also by setting Min_SE_Depth to 1600
Clear_hash: inits main, eval and pawn hash
